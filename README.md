## Installation

Add Coney as a dependency in your `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:coney, "~> 2.2"}]
end
```

After you are done, run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch and compile Coney.

## Setup a consumer server

Default config:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :coney,
  adapter: Coney.RabbitConnection,
  auto_start: true,
  settings: %{
    url: "amqp://guest:guest@localhost", # or ["amqp://guest:guest@localhost", "amqp://guest:guest@other_host"]
    timeout: 1000
  }
```

If you need to create exchanges or queues before starting the consumer, you can define your RabbitMQ topology as follows:
```elixir
config :coney,
  topology: %{
    exchanges: [{:topic, "my_exchange", durable: true}],
    queues: [
      %{
        name: "my_queue",
        options: [
          durable: true,
          arguments: [
            {"x-dead-letter-exchange", :longstr, "dlx_exchange"},
            {"x-message-ttl", :signedint, 60000}
          ]
        ],
        bindings: [
          [exchange: "my_exchange", options: [routing_key: "my_queue"]]
        ]
      }
    ]
  } 
```

```elixir
# config/test.exs

config :coney, auto_start: false
```

Also, you can create a confuguration module (if you want to retreive settings from Consul or something else):

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :coney,
  adapter: Coney.RabbitConnection,
  pool_size: 1,
  auto_start: true,
  settings: RabbitConfig,
  topology: RabbitConfig
```

```elixir
defmodule RabbitConfig do
  def rabbitmq_settings do
    %{
      url: "amqp://guest:guest@localhost",
      timeout: 1000
    }
  end
  
  def rabbitmq_topology do
  %{
    exchanges: [{:topic, "my_exchange", durable: true}],
    queues: [
      %{
        name: "my_queue",
        options: [
          durable: true,
          arguments: [
            {"x-dead-letter-exchange", :longstr, "exchange"},
            {"x-message-ttl", :signedint, 60000}
          ]
        ],
        bindings: [
          [exchange: "my_exchange", options: [routing_key: "my_queue"]]
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  end
end
```

If you don't want to automatically start Coney and want to control it's start, you can set `auto_start` to `false` and add Coney supervisor into yours:


```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :coney, auto_start: false
```

```elixir

defmodule YourApplication do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    Supervisor.start_link([Coney.ApplicationSupervisor], [strategy: :one_for_one])
  end
end
```

## Configure consumers

```
# config/queues.exs

config :coney,
  workers: [
    MyApplication.MyConsumer
  ]
# also you can define mapping like this and skip it in consumer module:
  workers: [
    %{
      connection: %{
        prefetch_count: 10,
        queue: "my_queue"
      },
      worker: MyApplication.MyConsumer
    }
  ]
```

```elixir
# web/consumers/my_consumer.ex

defmodule MyApplication.MyConsumer do
  @behaviour Coney.Consumer

  def connection do
    %{
      prefetch_count: 10,
      queue: "my_queue",
    }
  end

  def parse(payload, _meta) do
    String.to_integer(payload)
  end

  def process(number, _meta) do
    if number <= 10 do
      :ok
    else
      :reject
    end
  end

  # Be careful here, if call of `error_happened` will raise an exception,
  # message will be not handled properly and may be left unacked in a queue
  def error_happened(exception, payload, _meta) do
    IO.puts "Exception raised with #{ payload }"
    :redeliver
  end
end
```

### Rescuing exceptions

If exception was happened during calls of `parse` or `process` functions, by default Coney will reject this message. If you want to add additional functionality in order to handle exception in a special manner, you can implement one of `error_happened/3` or `error_happened/4` callbacks. But be careful, if call of `error_happened` will raise an exception, message will be not handled properly and may be left unacked in a queue.

#### error_happened/3

This callback receives `exception`, original `payload` and `meta` as parameters. Response format is the same as in [process callback](#process2-and-error_happened-return-format).

#### error_happened/4

This callback receives `exception`, `stacktrace`, original `payload` and `meta` as parameters. Response format is the same as in [process callback](#process2-and-error_happened-return-format).

### .process/2 and .error_happened return format

1. `:ok` - ack message.
1. `:reject` - reject message.
1. `:redeliver` - return message to the queue.
1. `{:reply, binary}` - response will be published to reply exchange.

### Reply description

To use `{:reply, binary}` you should add response exchange in `connection`:

```elixir
# web/consumers/my_consumer.ex

def connection do
  %{
    # ...
    respond_to: "response_exchange"
  }
end
```

Response will be published to `"response_exchange"` exchange.

### The default exchange

To use the default exchange you should set `connection.exchange` to `:default` parameter:

```elixir
# web/consumers/my_consumer.ex

def connection do
  %{
    # ...
    exchange: :default
  }
end
```
The following format is also acceptable:

```elixir
def connection do
  %{
    # ...
    exchange: {:direct, ""}
  }
end
```

## Publish message

```elixir
Coney.publish("exchange", "message")

# or

Coney.publish("exchange", "routing_key", "message")
```

## Checking connections

You can use`Coney.status/0` if you need to get information about RabbitMQ connections:

```
iex> Coney.status()
[{#PID<0.972.0>, :connected}]
```

Result is a list of tuples, where first element in tuple is a pid of running connection server and second element describes connection status.

Connection status can be:

- `:pending` - when coney just started
- `:connected` - when RabbitMQ connection has been established and all consumers have been started
- `:disconnected` - when coney lost connection to RabbitMQ
