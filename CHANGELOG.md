## [3.0.0]

### Enhancements
 - Introduce RabbitMQ `topology` configuration and setup. Coney now starts up in two phases, first it sets up the topology(queues/exchanges) and then starts consuming from the queues. This allows for more complex RabbitMQ setups like retry queues etc.
 - Remove pooling for clusters as this should be handled on cluster side instead

## [master]

### Enhancements

- `auto_start` option allow you choose how you want to start Coney. Use `false` value if you want to add `Coney.ApplicationSupervisor` to your supervisor. `true` (default value) means that Coney will run on application start.

- Settings module. You can speficfy a module name under `coney.settings` section and define `rabbitmq_settings/0` function, which should return connection configuration.
