## [3.1.3] (2025-01-03)

### Enhancements
- Add asynchronous message publishing.

## [3.1.2] (2024-08-16)

### Bug fixes
- Fix missing specification for `ConsumerServer` unique id

### Internal
- Prefix modules with `Coney.` to avoid conflicts

## [3.1.1] (2024-08-16) - BROKEN

### Bug fixes
- Fix missing `:name` when starting `ConsumerServer`

## [3.1.0] (2024-08-14) - BROKEN

### Enhancements
- Add `:enabled` config value
- `:adapter` config value is now optional and defaults to `Coney.RabbitConnection`

## [3.0.2] (2024-08-12) - BROKEN

### Bug fixes
- Fix incorrect termination order where the connection to RabbitMQ was closed before the channels.
- Implemented monitoring for spawned messages to improve tracebility.

## [3.0.1]

- Updated dependencies (`amqp`) #16

## [3.0.0]

### Changes

- Introduce RabbitMQ `topology` configuration and setup. Coney now starts up in two phases, first it sets up the topology (queues/exchanges) and then starts consuming from the queues. This allows more complex RabbitMQ setups like retry queues, etc.
- Remove pooling for clusters as this should be handled on cluster side instead.
- New option `consumer_tag` for worker `connection` settings.

### Enhancements

- `auto_start` option allow you choose how you want to start Coney. Use `false` value if you want to add `Coney.ApplicationSupervisor` to your supervisor. `true` (default value) means that Coney will run on application start.
- Settings module. You can speficfy a module name under `coney.settings` section and define `settings/0` function, which should return connection configuration.

        {:reject, "Number should be less than 10"}
      end
    end
  end
